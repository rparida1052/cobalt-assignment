# Backend URL Configuration
# For local development:
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000

# For ngrok tunneling (replace with your actual ngrok URL):
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app

# Development server port (optional)
VITE_PORT=5173

# Note: If using ngrok, make sure to:
# 1. Use ngrok with custom domain or paid plan to avoid browser warnings
# 2. Or add the ngrok domain to your browser's trusted sites
# 3. Or use localhost for development instead of ngrok
